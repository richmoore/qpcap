QPcap - A Qt wrapper for libpcap
================================

This library provides a Qt based API around libpcap.

Examples
========

Note that as with anything using raw sockets, these examples (and anything
else using this library) must be run as root.

demo1   Uses the Qt signal based api to print information about packets.
demo2   Uses the synchronous API to read a few packets.


Building
